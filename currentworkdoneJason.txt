This feature adds an audio feedback mechanic where the player character, John Lemon, plays a grunt sound upon colliding with environmental objects. The sound effect was sourced from freesound.org and imported into the Unity project under the 3DBeginnerComplete/Audio directory. A dedicated child GameObject named GruntSound was created under the main John Lemon object to hold an AudioSource component, which was assigned the downloaded grunt audio clip. The Play On Awake option was disabled to prevent the sound from playing at scene start. A custom script was attached to John Lemon that detects physical collisions and plays the grunt sound when appropriate. To avoid false triggers, the script includes a list of known floor object names (such as “FloorPlane,” and “Floor_Bathroom”) and ignores collisions with those specific objects. This solution avoids the use of Unity tags or layers to ensure compatibility with the rest of the team’s work and keeps all logic self-contained within the script. The result is a responsive, context-aware audio cue that enhances gameplay without interfering with other systems or assets.
